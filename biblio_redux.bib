	abstract = {Stock and flow diagrams are already an important tool in epidemiology, but category theory lets us go further and treat these diagrams as mathematical entities in their own right. In this chapter we use communicable disease models created with our software, StockFlow.jl, to explain the benefits of the categorical approach. We first explain the category of stock-flow diagrams and note the clear separation between the syntax of these diagrams and their semantics, demonstrating three examples of semantics already implemented in the software: ODEs, causal loop diagrams, and system structure diagrams. We then turn to two methods for building large stock-flow diagrams from smaller ones in a modular fashion: composition and stratification. Finally, we introduce the open-source ModelCollab software for diagram-based collaborative modeling. The graphical user interface of this web-based software lets modelers take advantage of the ideas discussed here without any knowledge of their categorical foundations.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic there was substantial variation between countries in the severity of the travel restrictions implemented suggesting a need for better importation models. Data to evaluate the accuracy of importation models is available for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL; September 2020 to June 2021) as arriving travelers were frequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 and travel-related cases were reported. Travel volume to NL was estimated from flight data, and travel declaration forms completed at entry to Canada, and at entry to NL during the pandemic. We found that during the pandemic travel to NL decreased by 82\%, the percentage of travelers arriving from Québec decreased (from 14 to 4\%), and from Alberta increased (from 7 to 17\%). We derived and validated an epidemiological model predicting the number of travelers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after arrival in NL, but found that statistical models with less description of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and with parameters fitted from the validation data more accurately predicted the daily number of travel-related cases reported in NL originating from Canada (R2 = 0.55, ΔAICc = 137). Our results highlight the importance of testing travelers and reporting travel-related cases as these data are needed for importation models to support public health decisions.
Significance Importation models consider epidemiology and inbound travel volumes to predict the arrival rate of infected travelers to a jurisdiction, and are used to guide travel restriction recommendations during outbreaks. A limitation of many importation models are that they are not validated with ‘real world’ data. Using data from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada, we develop an importation model that considers travel volumes estimated from travel declaration forms completed by arriving travelers, and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We validate the model using the number of travel-related cases reported from September 2020 to May 2021 in NL. Our results highlight the importance of reporting travel-related cases, and the need for detailed travel and epidemiological data to formulate reliable importation models.},

              Testing individuals for pathogens can affect the spread of epidemics. Understanding how individual-level processes of sampling and reporting test results can affect community- or population-level spread is a dynamical modeling question. The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends on factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on whom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the individual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level spread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has generic epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we have added a
              per capita
              testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing weights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases—surveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the relative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing, test-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast test reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because they can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and may enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the individual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals’ behaviour is affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some circumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can
              reduce
              the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions under which this occurs. Conversely, we find that focusing testing on infected individuals always acts to increase effectiveness of control.},
